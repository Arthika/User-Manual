Welcome to Arthika's ACT (Algorithmic Currency Trader) user manual.

Arthika's algorithm currency trading platform (called ACTP) allows traders operate in different trading markets  by using automated trading algorithms (trading strategies).

Before trading in these markets, users should become familiar with the platform and understand the underlying basic concepts and data model.
